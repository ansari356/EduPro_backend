# EduPro: Graduation Project Presentation Outline

---

### **1. Introduction & Problem Statement**

*   **Project Title:** EduPro - An Integrated Online Learning & Assessment Platform.

*   **The Problem:**
    For many independent educators and small institutions, creating a professional online presence is a significant challenge. They often have to rely on a patchwork of different tools for hosting content, managing students, processing payments, and conducting assessments. This fragmented approach is typically:
    *   **Inefficient:** Requiring educators to manage multiple platforms and manually sync data.
    *   **Costly:** Subscriptions to various services can quickly add up.
    *   **Disjointed:** Providing a confusing and inconsistent experience for both teachers and students.

*   **The Solution (EduPro):**
    EduPro addresses these challenges by providing a single, cohesive platform that empowers educators to build, manage, and monetize their own online courses. It seamlessly integrates content delivery, student management, and robust assessment tools into one unified system.

*   **Project Goals:**
    *   To provide teachers with a powerful yet intuitive toolkit to create and manage their online educational content.
    *   To offer students a structured, engaging, and seamless learning environment.
    *   To build a scalable, secure, and maintainable backend architecture capable of supporting a growing educational community.

### **2. Business Logic & User Workflow**

*   **The Teacher's Journey (The Educator as an Entrepreneur):**
    1.  **Setup & Branding:** A teacher registers on the platform and customizes their profile. This acts as their digital storefront, allowing them to establish a unique brand with their own logo and theme colors.
    2.  **Curriculum Creation:** The teacher designs their courses, structuring them logically into modules and lessons. They can upload a variety of content types, including videos and documents, to create a rich learning experience.
    3.  **Monetization & Marketing:** The educator has full control over their finances. They can set prices for entire courses or individual modules, offer free lessons as a marketing tool to attract new students, and create promotional coupons to drive enrollments.
    4.  **Student Management:** The teacher acts as an administrator for their own student base. They can view and manage enrollments, track student progress through the course material, and maintain the community by managing student access (e.g., blocking or unblocking users).

*   **The Student's Journey (A Streamlined Learning Experience):**
    1.  **Enrollment:** A student discovers a teacher and enrolls in their ecosystem, gaining access to their available courses.
    2.  **Learning:** The student navigates through the well-organized course content at their own pace, completing lessons and tracking their progress through a personal dashboard.
    3.  **Assessment & Feedback:** The student solidifies their knowledge by taking quizzes and exams, submitting assignments, and receiving grades. Crucially, they also receive personalized feedback from the teacher, which is vital for their learning and development.

### **3. System Architecture & Technology**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend Framework:** Django
    *   **API Development:** Django REST Framework
    *   **Authentication:** djangorestframework-simplejwt (JSON Web Tokens)
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL (psycopg2-binary)
    *   **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery with Redis for background processing (e.g., video encoding, sending notifications).
    *   **API Documentation:** drf-yasg (Swagger/OpenAPI) for clear, interactive API documentation.
    *   **Image & Video Processing:** Pillow, moviepy, imageio-ffmpeg.

*   **Database Design:**
    The database is designed around three core modules:
    *   **`userAuth`:** Manages users (`User` model with roles), their detailed profiles (`StudentProfile`, `TeacherProfile`), and the relationship between them (`TeacherStudentProfile`).
    *   **`course`:** Handles the educational content, including `Course`, `CourseModule`, and `Lesson`. It also manages `CourseEnrollment`, `ModuleEnrollment`, and monetization features like `Coupon` and `Rating`.
    *   **`assessments`:** Contains all assessment-related models, such as `Assessment` (for quizzes, exams), `Question`, `QuestionOption`, and the tracking of student performance through `StudentAssessmentAttempt` and `StudentAnswer`.

### **6. Live Demonstration Plan**

*   **Scenario:** Showcase the end-to-end user experience.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Teacher Registration:** A new teacher signs up and sets up their profile.
    2.  **Course Creation:** The teacher creates a new course, adds a module, and uploads a video lesson.
    3.  **Student Registration & Enrollment:** A new student registers and enrolls in the teacher's course.
    4.  **Learning & Assessment:** The student views the lesson and takes a short quiz.
    5.  **Grading & Feedback:** The teacher views the student's quiz attempt and provides feedback.

### **7. Future Enhancements**

*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide teachers with detailed analytics on student engagement, course performance, and revenue.
*   **Community Features:** Implement discussion forums or Q&A sections within courses to foster a sense of community.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce badges, points, and leaderboards to increase student motivation.
*   **Live Streaming:** Integrate live-streaming capabilities for real-time classes or webinars.
